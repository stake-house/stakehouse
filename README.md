# StakeHouse

StakeHouse is an extension of the EthStaker community focused on building tools that lower the technical bar to staking and promote the health of the beacon chain.

We live on the EthStaker [discord](https://invite.gg/ethstaker) in the #stakehouse channel.

## Our Tools (under development)

 - [Wagyu](https://github.com/stake-house/wagyu) - a one-click Eth2 staking installer
 - [Wizard](https://github.com/remyroy/eth2-validator-wizard) - a cli Eth2 staking installation wizard
 - [Port checker](https://github.com/ethstaker-core/eth2-client-port-checker) - a tool to identify whether you have the correct ports open
