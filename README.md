# StakeHouse

StakeHouse is an extension of the EthStaker community focused on building tools that lower the technical bar to staking and promote the health of the beacon chain.

We are growing and welcome contributors of all types to jump in and help with design, development, testing, idea generation, documentation, resource creation, etc!

We live on the EthStaker [discord](https://invite.gg/ethstaker) in the #stakehouse🥩🏠 channel.  Come say hi!

## Our Tools (under development)

 - [Wagyu](https://github.com/stake-house/wagyu) - a one-click Eth2 staking installer
 - [Wizard](https://github.com/stake-house/eth2-validator-wizard) - a cli-based Eth2 staking installation wizard
 - [Wagyu Key Gen](https://github.com/stake-house/wagyu-key-gen) - a GUI wrapper around the [deposit cli](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-deposit-cli) to assist in creating your keys
 - [Port checker](https://github.com/stake-house/eth2-client-port-checker) - a tool to identify whether you have the correct ports open
 - [POAP Reddit Bot](https://github.com/stake-house/poap-reddit-bot) - a code distribution tool for POAP events

## Tools and projects in need of testing

- [Wizard](https://github.com/stake-house/eth2-validator-wizard) - We need more users to test this on Pyrmont, Prater and Mainnet.
- [Eth2xK8s](https://github.com/lumostone/eth2xk8s) - We need more users to test this on Prater. If you are familiar with Kubernetes or you want to learn more about it, this is a great project to start on.

We would love to hear your feedback if you decide to try these projects. Make sure to join our #stakehouse🥩🏠 channel on [discord](https://invite.gg/ethstaker).
