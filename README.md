# StakeHouse

StakeHouse is an extension of the EthStaker community focused on building tools that lower the technical bar to staking and promote the health of the beacon chain.

We are growing and welcome contributors of all types to jump in and help with design, development, testing, idea generation, documentation, resource creation, etc!

We live on the EthStaker [discord](https://invite.gg/ethstaker) in the #stakehouse channel.  Come say hi!
